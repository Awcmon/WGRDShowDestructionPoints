Shows how many kills the first two players have in a replay in Wargame: Red Dragon

Appears to work on all gamemodes, even team games, but it will only show the first two players, as previously stated.

How to use it:
Download it and run it once WarGame is already running. Again, make sure WarGame is already running or the program will just auto-close itself.

If somebody wants to make an overlay, be my guest.

Windows only unfortunately.
