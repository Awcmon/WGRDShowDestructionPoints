# WGRDShowDestructionPoints

Shows how many kills the first two players have in a game of wargame. 

Appears to work on all gamemodes, even team games, but it will only show the first two players, as previously stated.

It works in both replays and live games. Lmfao.

How to use it:
Download it and run it once WarGame is already running. Again, make sure WarGame is already running or the program will just auto-close itself.

If somebody wants to make an overlay, be my guest.

Windows only unfortunately.
